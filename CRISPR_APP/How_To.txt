
Perturbation (Safe Posterior) — Explore Mixscape perturbation scores.

Posterior Violin — View per-guide distributions of posterior scores.

Heatmap (Safe DE) — Inspect DE genes across groups.

Pathway Enrichment Analysis

Use the Pathway Enrichment tab to find biological pathways enriched among your DE genes.

Choose between g:Profiler (multi-species) or Enrichr (human/mouse-focused).

Click Enrich ALL, Enrich UP, or Enrich DOWN:

A notification will appear while enrichment runs.

When complete, you’ll see barplots and tables of significant pathways.

You can also download enrichment results as CSV files for each category.

Download Results

Download KO gene tables, summary stats, and pathway enrichment outputs directly from the app.

File names include timestamps for easy record keeping.

💡 Tips

Ensure metadata matches your counts matrix (same cell IDs and consistent labels).

If Mixscape fails, check that:

Each KO and NT group has enough cells.

Your guide labeling column (e.g., perturbation or mixscape_class_global) is correct.

Enrichment works best when ≥20 DE genes are detected per comparison.

If enrichment results show “No terms returned,” check your species selection and gene naming format.

You’ll now see live notifications whenever enrichment is running or completed.

Enjoy exploring your CRISPR perturbation data!
