# How to Use the JCAP CRISPR Mixscape Pipeline App

1. **Upload Your Data**
   - Use the sidebar to upload your counts matrix (.csv) and metadata (.csv).

2. **Run Basic Analysis**
   - Click the **Run Normalization & UMAP** button to process your data and see the UMAP plots.

3. **View Summary Table**
   - Once the basic analysis is complete, click **Show Summary Stats** to see a summary table of cell, gene, and group counts.

4. **Adjust Parameters (Optional)**
   - If desired, adjust the "Number of Neighbors" slider to tune downstream analysis.

5. **Run Mixscape Analysis**
   - Click **Run Mixscape Analysis**. This classifies cells as KO, NP, or NT, and enables downstream differential expression and visualization.

6. **Explore the Results**
   - Navigate through the tabs to view:
     - UMAP plots
     - Summary statistics
     - KO gene table (differential expression)
     - KO percentage barplots
     - Perturbation score plots
     - Posterior violin plots
     - Mixscape heatmap

7. **Download Results**
   - Use the download buttons to export the KO gene table and summary statistics for your records.

**Tips:**
- Make sure your metadata and counts files are formatted correctly. (See example files if unsure.)
- If you encounter an error, check that each group/replicate has enough cells for Mixscape to run.
- Some plots may be empty if there is not enough data or if Mixscape cannot classify enough cells.
- For help, check this How To, or reach out to the app maintainer.

Enjoy your analysis!
